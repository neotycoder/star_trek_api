# star_trek_api

Created this repo as a lock down project. I'm busy with stuff most of the time, and with everything closed, I'm spending more time at home. I've gotten bored of just streaming content, and watching the news is just one big revolving door of negativity and boredom. 

So one night, I did a Google search and discovered that someone created a Star Trek API. Wow, that's cool. 

You can find details on the Star Trek API here: http://stapi.co/

I created a sample file to show how you can make REST calls to the service. There are details on the website on other REST endpoints you can use.

I haven't gone as far as to how to make a specific query on a specific category. My example script shows how to do bulk searches. So, hope you have fun with it. :)
